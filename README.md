# Multipage Bolero Demo

This is a simple proof of concept project to take the Bolero template and separate the pages into separate files/modules, with a few modifications as possible. The functionality is identical between the original template and this project.

The methodology is heavily inspired by notes from the Elmish project on ["parent-child composition"](https://elmish.github.io/elmish/index.html) with a [minimal example project](https://elmish.github.io/elmish/parent-child.html).

Requires .NET Core 3.1 or higher. See [fsbolero.io](https://fsbolero.io/) and [elmish.github.io](https://elmish.github.io/elmish/index.html) for more notes.
